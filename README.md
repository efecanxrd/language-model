<h2> How this is working? </h2>
<h4> This code defines a simple LSTM-based language model that predicts the next character in a sequence given a sequence of previous characters. It trains the model on a dataset of text sequences and then generates new text using the trained model.

Note that this is just a basic example, and there are many ways to customize and improve upon this model depending on your specific use case.
